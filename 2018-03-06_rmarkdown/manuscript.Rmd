# Introduction
Here is an introduction. This paper explores the relationship between calorie content and sugars in specialty coffee beverages made by the Starbucks industry.

Starbucks recently introduced calorie counts on their menus, a marketing move reflecting consumer trends motivated in part by the recent findings of [@bleich2015]. Other research on this topic will be cited here in parentheses [@drewnowski2003; @malik2010]. @weaver2003 demonstrated the use of an inline citation here. 

# Methods
Here is the methods section. Refer to this section in the manuscript.Rmd file to see how we:

1. Input a table that does not use R code
2. Insert a figure that does not use R code
3. Insert an equation
4. Insert a footnote

## Insert Markdown tables
The following table similarly demonstrates absolutely nothing useful except how to generate a simple table in RMarkdown.

|  Weekday  |  Kind of coffee I drank  | Happiness |
|:---------:|:------------------------:|:---------:|
|   Monday  |       Black coffee       |     5     |
|  Tuesday  |           Latte          |      4    |
| Wednesday |        Cappuccino        |     7     |
|  Thursday |       Black coffee       |     5     |
|   Friday  |         No coffee        |     0     |
|  Saturday |       Irish coffee       |     9     |
|   Sunday  | Orange mocha frappuccino |     11    |

## Insert a figure

## Inset equations
Here is a nifty equation that shows absolutely nothing except how to include an equation: 

<!-- COMMENTS! -->
<!-- The text enclosed in dollar signs $ $ will be treated as LaTex math (an equation), and will be formatted especially for this -->

Amount I wish I could spend on coffee = $\frac{10(coffee\ budget ^ 2)}{my\ income}* \$ 1\ bazillion$. 

## Insert footnotes.
Because we specified footnotes in the markdown extensions in our YAML[^1], we can now include them in the text.

[^1]: This is the footnote.

# Results

This is where the results will go in a moment. For now, notice the chunk is commented out.

I have written the results section separately to keep things nice and tidy, and this is where I will call it as "child" input. 
It is important that R chunks (identifiable as sandwiched between three back ticks \`\`\`) in the child file don't have the same names as chunks in the main file.

<!-- ```{r child = 'results.Rmd'} -->

<!-- ``` -->
